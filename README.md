# Tools_scripts

<p>Added function_extrat.py<br />Problem statement:- Suppose you have 100s of C language source code and you want to only extract function defination, nothing else.<br />function_extract script takes file.c as input and prints all function on standard output, so you have the option to redirect it to a file.</p>
