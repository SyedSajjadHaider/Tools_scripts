# Tools_scripts

<p>Added function_extrat.py<br />Problem statement:- Suppose you have 100s of C language source code and you want to only extract function defination, nothing else.<br />function_extract script takes file.c as input and prints all function on standard output, so you have the option to redirect it to a file.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="css-truncate css-truncate-target d-block width-fit">debug_helper_for_c.py</span><br />Problem statement:- Suppose you want to add a print debug statement to each function, but there are 100s of function, so in this case, you can use this script, as this script automatically detects a function and include debug statement.</p>
